abstract: "The Earth’s interior, particularly the Earth’s fluid outer core, possesses a broad dynamics of processes involving mass variations. Theoretical models predict variations of the gravity field at low degrees and at inter-annual / decadal time scales. These include dynamic pressure changes at the Core Mantle Boundary (CMB) associated with core flows reconstructed from geomagnetic observations and reorientation of the inner core controlled by gravitational coupling with the mantle. The hypothetical effects due to some dissolution/crystallization at the CMB introduce a time-varying roughness of the interface. Taking into account these considerations, for the first time, we investigate the density and pressure changes obtained from magneto-hydro-dynamics (MHD) simulations that reproduce geomagnetic jerk"
