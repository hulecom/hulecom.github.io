  abstract={The Earth’s interior, particularly the Earth’s fluid outer core, possesses a broad dynamics of processes involving mass variations. Theoretical models predict variations of the gravity field at low degrees and at inter-annual / decadal time scales. These include density anomalies in the fluid core, dynamic pressure changes at the Core Mantle Boundary (CMB) associated with core flows and reorientation of the inner core controlled by gravitational coupling with the mantle. Taking into account these considerations, we estimate gravity variations created by the density and pressure changes obtained from magneto-hydro-dynamics (MHD) simulations. \n\n We shed light on the estimated amplitude of gravity signals created by core processes regarding to the future accuracy of the MAGIC Level 2 products of the time variable gravity field. To verify the capacity of detecting Earth’s core signature, we generate synthetic core signals that we incorporate into gravity products. Then, we aim to retrieve these synthetic signals through different analysis methods. We use decomposition methods such as wavelet and Empirical Orthogonal Function analyses. \n\n We estimate the imperatives criteria necessary to expect to be able to study Earth’s interior with MAGIC products. It includes, notably, the continuation of GRACE-like measurement of the Earth system for accessing decadal time scale in gravity field variations.},
