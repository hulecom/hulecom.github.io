abstract: "The differential axial rotation of the solid inner core is suggested by seismic observations and expected from core dynamics models. A rotation of the inner core by an angle α takes its degree 2, order 2 topography (peak-to-peak amplitude δh) out of its gravitational alignment with the mantle. This creates a gravity variation of degree 2, order 2 proportional to δh and to α. Here, we use gravity observations from Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR), the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and GRACE Follow-On to reconstruct the time-variable S<sub>2,2</sub> Stokes coefficient. We show that for δh=90 m, S<sub>2,2</sub> provides upper bounds on α of 0.09°, 0.3°, and 0.4° at periods of 4, 5 to 6, and 8 to 12 years, respectively. These are overestimates, as our reconstructed S<sub>2,2</sub> signal likely remains polluted by hydrology, although viscous relaxation of the inner core can permit larger amplitudes"
