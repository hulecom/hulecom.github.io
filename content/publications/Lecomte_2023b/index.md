abstract: "The differential axial rotation of the solid inner core is suggested by seismic observations and expected from core dynamics models. A rotation of the inner core by an angle α takes its degree 2, order 2 topography (peak-to-peak amplitude δh) out of its gravitational alignment with the mantle. This creates a gravity variation of degree 2, order 2 proportional to δh and to α. Here, we use gravity observations from Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR), the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and GRACE Follow-On to reconstruct the time-variable $"
