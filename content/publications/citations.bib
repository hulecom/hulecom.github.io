    abstract = {Space gravity measurements have been mainly used to study the temporal mass variations at the Earth's surface and within the mantle. Nevertheless, mass variations due to the Earth's core might be observable in the gravity field variations as measured by GRACE(-FO) satellites. Earth’s core dynamical processes inferred from geomagnetic field measurements are characterized by large-scale patterns associated with low spherical harmonic degrees of the potential fields. To study these processes, the use of large spatial and inter-annual temporal filters is needed. To access gravity variations related to the Earth’s core, surface effects must be corrected, including hydrological, oceanic or atmospheric loading (Newtonian attraction and mass redistribution). However, these corrections for surface processes add errors to the estimates of the residual gravity field variations enclosing deep Earth’s signals. As our goal is to evaluate the possibility to detect signals of core origin embedded in the residual gravity field variations, a quantification of the uncertainty associated with gravity field products and geophysical models used to minimise the surface process signatures is necessary. Here, we estimate the dispersion for GRACE solutions as about 0.34 cm of Equivalent Water Height (EWH) or 20% of the total signal. Uncertainty for hydrological models is as large as 0.89 to 2.10 cm of EWH. We provide estimates of Earth’s core signals whose amplitudes are compared with GRACE gravity field residuals and uncertainties. The results presented here underline how challenging is to get new information about the dynamics of the Earth's core via high-resolution, high-accuracy gravity data.}

  abstract = {The differential axial rotation of the solid inner core is suggested by seismic observations and expected from core dynamics models. A rotation of the inner core by an angle α takes its degree 2, order 2 topography (peak-to-peak amplitude δh) out of its gravitational alignment with the mantle. This creates a gravity variation of degree 2, order 2 proportional to δh and to α. Here, we use gravity observations from Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR), the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and GRACE Follow-On to reconstruct the time-variable S<sub>2,2</sub> Stokes coefficient. We show that for δh=90 m, S<sub>2,2</sub> provides upper bounds on α of 0.09°, 0.3°, and 0.4° at periods of 4, 5 to 6, and 8 to 12 years, respectively. These are overestimates, as our reconstructed S<sub>2,2</sub> signal likely remains polluted by hydrology, although viscous relaxation of the inner core can permit larger amplitudes.}

  abstract = {We propose a benchmark for comparing gap-filling techniques used on global time-variable gravity field time-series. The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and the GRACE Follow-On missions provide products to study the Earth’s time-variable gravity field. However, the presence of missing months in the measurements poses challenges for understanding specific Earth processes through the gravity field. We reproduce, adapt, and compare satellite-monitoring and interpolation techniques for filling these missing months in GRACE and GRACE Follow-On products on a global scale. Satellite-monitoring techniques utilize solutions from Swarm and satellite laser ranging, while interpolation techniques rely on GRACE and/or Swarm solutions. We assess a wide range of interpolation techniques, including least-squares fitting, principal component analysis, singular spectrum analysis, multichannel singular spectrum analysis, auto-regressive models, and the incorporation of prior data in these techniques. To inter-compare these techniques, we employ a remove-and-restore approach, removing existing GRACE products and predicting missing months using interpolation techniques. We provide detailed comparisons of the techniques and discuss their strengths and limitations. The auto-regressive interpolation technique delivers the best score according to our evaluation metric. The interpolation based on a least-squares fitting of constant, trend, annual, and semi-annual cycles offers a simple and effective prediction with a good score. Through this assessment, we establish a starting benchmark for gap-filling techniques in Earth’s time-variable gravity field analysis.}
