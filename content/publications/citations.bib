  abstract = {Abstract This study presents reflectivity images of the northeast (NE) Japan subduction zone continuous across the ocean and land. As nearly half of its forearc region is under the ocean, data from ocean bottom seismometers (OBSs) must be utilized to fully image the region by passive seismic analysis. The use of OBS data has been a challenge due to inherent characters of the ocean bottom observations: high noise level and effects of seafloor sediment. Now, decent imaging is possible in NE Japan overcoming the high level noise due to the accumulated data set of the OBSs. The low-velocity of seafloor sediment significantly delays and amplifies S waves passing through them, and thus complicates teleseismic waveforms. We identify and correct these effects to produce coherent receiver function images throughout the amphibious subduction zone. Our images provide a potential for discussing new structural features and will help better understanding of the dynamics of the NE Japan subduction zone.},
