  abstract={The GRACE and GRACE Follow-On (GRACE-FO) missions have been providing monthly time-variable gravity field estimates since 2002 with a one-year gap between 2017 and 2018. The Level 2 data products are available through several processing centers with independent computation strategies. As part of the GRACE/GRACE-FO Science Data System (SDS), the Center of Space Research (CSR), the German Research Centre for Geosciences (GFZ) and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) process gravity data with RL06 standards. The French Space Agency (CNES) and the Graz University of Technology deliver GRACE gravity fields models respectively named CNES/GRGS RL05 and ITSG-GRACE2018. The International Combination Service for Time-variable Gravity Field (COST-G) makes available a product resulting of the combination of different processing centers including among others the previously mentioned products. In addition to GRACE data, the European Space Agency (ESA) has been delivering Level 2 data products from the Swarm mission since 2013. Swarm data provides information for the gap-fill between the GRACE and GRACE-FO missions. With appropriate corrections, these datasets are valuable inputs to investigate the deep Earth’s interior. We put the focus on the core-mantle boundary (CMB) processes and core dynamics that would induce gravity field perturbations at the Earth’s surface.\n\n Earth's core dynamical processes inferred from geomagnetic field measurements are characterized by large-scale patterns. Studying them via gravity field observations involves the use of spherical harmonic coefficients up to degree and order 8. Particular attention needs to be dedicated to Stokes coefficients that are affected by problematic reconstruction effects such as C<sub>2,0</sub> or C<sub>3,0</sub>. The comparison of time-series from various processing centers with Satellite-Laser Ranging (SLR) gravity products and hydrological loading models provides information on the consistency between different solutions and the accuracy of space gravity-field measurements. The corrections of hydrological and glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) effects are an additional source of error in the determination of the gravity field. For example, the current uncertainty of the GIA model over North America might lead to an error of some 10% for specific Stokes coefficients. Mismodelling in the seasonal loading could also affect the retrieved Stokes coefficients.\n\n Here, we discuss the differences between  the gravity field solutions in terms of accuracy of the observed gravity field variation and finally the ability to detect core signals.},

  abstract={The GRACE and GRACE Follow-On missions provide monthly time-variable gravity field estimates since 2002 with a 11-month gap between 2017-2018. This gap makes it difficult to retrieve gravity variations signals with pluri-annual and decadal temporal scales. This poster summarizes diverse approaches proposed in the literature and compare them. Some are an extrapolation of the GRACE products, others propose to use Swarm gravity field products to deduce the missing data.The estimation of the accuracy of the Swarm product is an order of magnitude larger than the accuracy of the GRACE product with a truncation at degree 12. Comparison of estimation techniques suggests that a spherical harmonics approach is more precise to reconstruct the GRACE data and that the Swarm product might pollute the reconstruction. The best reconstruction uses a Single Spectrum Analysis on spherical harmonics with only GRACE products. This reconstruction will provide a great addition to the study of long term gravity processes.},

  abstract={Les variations du champ de gravité terrestre sont liées à diverses sources d’amplitudes et d’échelles spatio-temporelles différentes. Les principales causes de ces variations sont les effets de marées, les surcharges hydrologiques, atmosphériques et océaniques, le rebond post-glaciaire et les séismes.  D’amplitudes bien moindres, les processus dans le noyau liquide terrestre contribuent également aux perturbations du champ de gravité terrestre. Les variations du champ de gravité sont mesurées mensuellement par les satellites GRACE et GRACE Follow-On depuis 2002. Les produits gravimétriques issus de ces satellites sont distribués par différents centres d’analyse avec des stratégies de traitement différentes. Dans ce travail, nous nous concentrons sur des signaux pluriannuels et  d’amplitudes spatiales supérieures à 1500 km qui pourraient être générés par différents processus à l’interface noyau-manteau. Nous proposons une comparaison des produits gravimétriques, ainsi qu’une comparaison des surcharges hydrologiques prédites pour différents modèles hydrologiques globaux. À nos échelles d’intérêt, la cohérence entre les produits des différents centres et celle entre les produits de surcharges hydrologiques est d’environ 3 centimètres en équivalent de variations de hauteur d’eau. Ces différences entre les produits sont un premier indicateur de l’exactitude de ces derniers. Cette exactitude mise au regard des amplitudes attendues de la part des variations gravimétriques induites par des processus du noyau indique que l’observation de ces variations est à la limite de ce qu’il est possible d’observer aujourd’hui.},

  abstract={Space gravity measurements have been mainly used to study temporal mass variations at the Earth’s surface and within the mantle. Nevertheless, recent studies indicate that mass variations due to the Earth’s core might be observable in the variations of the gravity field as measured by GRACE and GRACE-FO satellites. Moreover, a possible correlation between the variable gravity and magnetic fields has been pointed out at decadal time scales. To access these gravity variations, other known surficial effects must be corrected such as hydrological, oceanic or atmospheric loadings. However, these corrections also add errors to the final product.\n\n Earth's core dynamical processes inferred from geomagnetic field measurements are characterized by large-scale patterns. Studying them via gravity field observations involves the use of low degree spherical harmonic coefficients, saying up to degree and order 8. We compare the corrections of several glacial isostatic adjustment, hydrological, oceanic and atmospheric loading models for these larges scales. These comparisons provide us with an estimate of the uncertainty associated with each correction.\n\n With the benefit of nearly two decades of space gravity data, we finally create a time-variable gravity field product, which considered the multiple corrections indicated above. This offers the possibility to revisit the correlation analyses between the gravity and magnetic fields.},

  abstract={The GRACE and GRACE Follow-On missions are separated by an 11-month gap between 2017 and 2018 and contain 22 more missing months. These gaps in the time series lead to a difficult recovery of gravity variation signals with pluri-annual temporal scales. In this context, various studies proposed machine learning approaches and decomposition techniques to predict the missing values.\n\n This study summarizes the different approaches that we have implemented and compares their results. We consider both grid and spherical harmonics at global scales. Some gap-filling solutions use an extrapolation of the GRACE products and some others propose to use Swarm gravity field products to reduce the missing data. We tested several methods in terms of their capacity to predict signals on monthly or annual periods, randomly chosen between 2005 and 2010. The Root-Mean Square Error between the predictions and the original solution gives an estimation of the uncertainty associated with each method.\n\n We show that simple methods like « Constant, Trend, Annual and Semi-annual fit » do not deliver the complexity of the original signal. We finally conclude that the Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) and Multivariate SSA produce the best results at large spatial scales.},

  Besides the geomagnetic information, we also are interested in exploiting long series of gravity measurements. The time-variable Earth’s gravity field is measured by satellite missions such as GRACE and GRACE Follow-On and by Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR). These products enable to study continental hydrology, oceanic and atmospheric loading, post-glacial rebound, glaciers, earthquakes and other phenomena that involve mass variations. The comparison of GRACE and SLR gravity field variations with Earth’s core predicted signals gives new inputs on parameters of the Earth’s core processes. This study provides new upper-bound values for pressure anomalies at the CMB and angle of reorientation for the inner core.},
